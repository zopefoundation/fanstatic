0.11 (unreleased)
=================

- Add entry point for wsgi middleware.

- Moved ZCA plugin to hurry.zoperesource.

- Plugins now have two responsibilities:

  1. Leaving a NeededInclusions() object in the WSGI environment.

  2. Leaving a `base_url` attribute on this NeededInclusions object.

- The WSGI `injector` middleware takes care of rendering the needed inclusions
  into the HTML.

- Add hashing functionality that calculates a checksum of a resource library.

- Hurry.resource.wsgi knows about publishing resources.

- The hurry.resource.wsgi injector middleware informs the wrapped application
  of the presence of a resource publisher.

- Do not serve hidden files in hurry.resource.publisher.

- Publisher only sets cache control header on successful responses.

- Configure hashing and devmode.

- In devmode, don't re-compute the hash. The hash is stored on the Library
  instance.

0.10 (2010-07-24)
=================

* The WSGI Middleware depends on WebOb, which is an optional
  dependency. Don't expose it into the ``__init__.py`` therefore, as
  that needs to be independent of WebOb. To use the middleware import
  it directly from ``hurry.resource.wsgi``.

* The ``Library`` factory now has to be called with a rootpath
  argument as the second argument. This is a path to the actual
  resource directory that the library represents, relative to the
  directory of the package. This is needed to make `` hurry.resource``
  useful for frameworks not based on ``zope.configuration``.

  This breaks backwards compatibility with previous versions of
  ``hurry.resource``; all code that uses ``Library`` should be
  adjusted. Please also update their ``setup.py`` to depend on
  ``hurry.resource >= 0.10``.

* Packages should register their ``Library`` instances with
  ``hurry.resource`` using the ``hurry.resource.libraries`` entry
  point.

0.9 (2010-07-13)
================

* WSGI support: ``hurry.resource.Middleware`` can be used to wrap WSGI
  applications. If the application supplies a ``NeededInclusions``
  object in ``environ`` with the key ``hurry.resource.needed``, the
  middleware will pick up on this and insert the needed inclusions.

  The WebOb library is needed to make this work and depending on
  ``hurry.resource [wsgi]`` will pull in the required dependency.

* Fixed some typos in README.txt.

0.4.1 (2009-12-16)
==================

* Fix restructured text.

0.4 (2009-12-16)
================

* Expose a ``GroupInclusion`` that only exists to depend on other
  inclusions. This way it becomes possible to expose a set of
  different resources together without there being a central resource
  that depends on them. The GroupInclusion itself is therefore not
  rendered.

* Create ``render_into_html`` and ``render_topbottom_into_html``
  functionality, which insert the rendered inclusions into HTML.

* Expose ``render``, ``render_into_html``, ``render_topbottom`` and
  ``render_topbottom_into_html`` as top-level functions in
  ``hurry.resource``.

* Fix NameError when trying to render an inclusion with unknown extension.

* Document inclusion renderers mechanism in the README.txt.

0.3 (2008-10-15)
================

Features added
--------------

* Consolidating resources into rollups is now disabled by
  default. This is to help developers with debugging; rollups are
  typically minified for optimization purposes, and libraries such as
  YUI do not offer rollups in non-minified form. Since rollups must
  now be explicitly enabled by the application developer
  (``hurry.resource.rollup()``), an application developer who needs to
  debug can choose not to call it (or call
  ``hurry.resource.rollup(disable=True``).

* Added an optimization section to the documentation.

* Added some more details about how modes are expected to be used to
  the documentation.

Bug fixes
---------

* ``hurry.resource.bottom`` now takes a second optional ``disable``
  parameter.

0.2 (2008-10-13)
================

* Changed the API to set the mode. Instead of passing it to ``render``
  and ``inclusions``, the requested mode can be set with the ``mode``
  method on ``INeededInclusions``. For convenience there is a ``mode``
  function as well that can be imported directly from
  ``hurry.resource`` that sets the mode for the current needed
  inclusions.

* Added support for rendering resources into two fragments, one to
  be included at the top of the HTML page in the ``<head>`` section,
  the other to be included just before the ``</body>`` section. In
  some circumstances doing this can `speed up page load time`_.

0.1 (2008-10-07)
